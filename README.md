# Knight-Travails
The Knight Travels project is a JavaScript implementation of exploring the movement of a chess knight on a standard 8x8 chessboard. A chess knight has the unique ability to move to any square on the board from any other square, given enough moves (don't believe it? See this animation). Its basic move involves taking two steps in one direction and one step in a perpendicular direction or one step in one direction and two steps in a perpendicular direction. It can change its direction at any time.

This project aims to explore and visualize the possible movements of a chess knight on a chessboard. It can be used for educational purposes to help people understand the knight's movement, or as a foundation for more advanced chess-related projects.

Features
Visualization of the knight's movement on a virtual chessboard.
The ability to specify the starting position of the knight.
Exploring the possible knight moves within a certain number of moves.
An interactive user interface for selecting the number of moves.
